def patch_torch_load_weights_only():
    """
    Patch torch.load to use weights_only=False by default.

    This is a workaround for PyTorch 2.6+ which changed the default
    value of weights_only from False to True. Many older model checkpoints
    (e.g., pyannote.audio VAD models used by WhisperX) contain objects
    that require pickle unpickling and fail with weights_only=True.

    This patch should be called BEFORE importing libraries that load
    such checkpoints (e.g., whisperx, pyannote.audio).

    Note:
        This reduces security as it allows arbitrary code execution
        during model loading. Only use with trusted model sources.

    Example:
        >>> from src.utils.torch_compat import patch_torch_load_weights_only
        >>> patch_torch_load_weights_only()
        >>> import whisperx  # Now whisperx can load VAD models
